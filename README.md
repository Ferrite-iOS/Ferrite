# Ferrite

A media search engine for iOS with a plugin API to extend its functionality.

## Disclaimer

This project is developed with a hobbyist/educational purpose and I am not responsible for what happens when you install Ferrite.

Ferrite does not and will never host any content. It is a search engine and will be nothing more.

## Why did I make this?

Finding shows and movies is usually pretty easy because there are many websites out there with the ability to search for the files you want.

However, the main problem is that these websites tend to suck in terms of UI or finding media to watch. Ferrite aims to provide a better UI to search and find the media you want.

I also wanted to support the use of debrid services since there aren't any (free) options on iOS that have support for this service.

## What iOS versions are supported?

- v0.7 and up: iOS 15 and up

- v0.6.x and lower: iOS 14 and up

## Planned features

More of these can be found in [issues](https://github.com/bdashore3/Ferrite/issues), but here is a small snippet:

- A decentralized actions API: Allows for playback on other devices

- More involved search filtering

- Companion apps for playback on other devices

## Downloads

Ferrite will only exist as an ipa. There are and will never be any plans to release on TestFlight or the App Store. Ipa builds are automatically built and are provided in Github actions artifacts.

## Plugins/Sources

Sources are not provided by the application. They must be found from external means or you can make them yourself using the [wiki](https://github.com/bdashore3/Ferrite/wiki). Various communities have created sources for Ferrite and they can be imported in the app with ease.

## Building from source

Xcode 14 must be used.

There are currently two branches in the repository:

- default: A snapshot of the latest stable build. Tags can also be used for older versions.
- next: The development branch. Nightlies are automatically built here.

## Nightly builds

Nightlies are builds automatically compiled by GitHub actions. These are development builds which may or may not be stable!

It is required to log into GitHub or ask for a [nightly link](https://nightly.link/) to grab a build.

To install a nightly build:

1. Download the artifact from GitHub actions

2. Unzip the file containing the ipa

3. Install the ipa on your device
